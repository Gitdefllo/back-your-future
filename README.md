# Back-your-future

For the database, create one on [mLab](https://mlab.com/) and set the keys into `MongoDb.kt`:  

```java
private const val DB_USER = ""
private const val DB_PASS = ""
private const val DB_NAME = ""
private const val DB_URI = "mongodb://$DB_USER:$DB_PASS@ds00000.mlab.com:00000/$DB_NAME"
```
